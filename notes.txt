1. Gain/volume, scalar multiplier
2. Equalization, balance frequencies (lo/hi/band pass)
3. Panning, split mono to stereo and modulate channel volumes
4. Dynamic range compression, non-linear gain reduction
5. Clipping/distortion, nonlinear (hard/soft clipping) functions
6. Amplitude modulation, tremolo, vary volume w/low freq. oscillator
